# ToDoAI


**Project Name:** "ToDai: The AI-Powered To-Do List"

**Project Description:**

SmartList revolutionizes task management by leveraging AI to prioritize, categorize, and even suggest tasks based on your patterns, deadlines, and natural language inputs.

**Core Features:**

* **Intelligent Task Prioritization:**  AI models analyze task descriptions, due dates, and historical data to automatically prioritize tasks, helping users focus on what matters most.
* **Smart Categorization:** The app automatically categorizes tasks based on keywords or phrases, making it easy to organize and filter.
* **Natural Language Input:**  Users can add tasks using natural language (e.g., "Get groceries tomorrow"), and the app parses the input into structured task data.
* **Task Suggestions:** Based on user behavior and patterns, the app suggests potential tasks or reminders.
* **Deadline Management:** AI-powered reminders and notifications help users stay on track with deadlines.
* **Cloud Storage and Synchronization:** Tasks are securely stored in the cloud, ensuring access from any device and seamless synchronization.

**AI Components:**

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Parsing natural language task inputs, extracting relevant information (dates, priority, category).
* **Machine Learning (ML):**  Models for task prioritization (e.g., using classification algorithms), task categorization (e.g., using clustering), and task suggestion (e.g., using collaborative filtering or sequence modeling).

**End-to-End Infrastructure:**

* **Frontend:** Web application built with React/Vue.js or a mobile app (iOS/Android) for a user-friendly interface.
* **Backend:** Python Flask/FastAPI API for handling user interactions and AI model calls.
* **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing task data.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured data storage.
* **AI Model Deployment:** Containerize models using Docker and deploy on Kubernetes (AWS EKS, Google GKE) or a serverless platform (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for scalability.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the build, testing, and deployment process using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement logging with Elasticsearch/Kibana (ELK Stack) and monitor system health with Prometheus and Grafana.

**Additional Ideas for Showcasing Skills:**

* **Personalization:** Train models on individual user data to further improve task suggestions and prioritization.
* **Integration:** Integrate with calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook) or communication tools (Slack, Teams).
* **Offline Mode:**  Allow users to add and view tasks offline, with automatic synchronization when back online.
* **Voice Input:**  Add support for voice input using speech recognition APIs.
* **Gamification:**  Introduce elements of gamification (badges, rewards) to make task management more engaging.

**Portfolio Presentation:**

Showcase your end-to-end skills by:

* **Architecture Diagram:** Create a clear diagram outlining the infrastructure components and how they interact.
* **Code Repository:** Make your project code available on GitHub or GitLab.
* **Demo Video/Screenshots:**  Provide a compelling demo showcasing the app's features and user experience.
* **Metrics:** If possible, share some metrics on model performance (e.g., accuracy of task prioritization).
* **Deployment Instructions:**  Provide clear instructions on how to deploy and run the app.

This project will not only demonstrate your AI development abilities but also your full-stack engineering prowess, making you a strong candidate for AI engineering roles.
